# ws2brz - Wikispecies to .BRZ

To use, first get the big xml dump from here:

Next put the file in this folder and run species.sh

This will execute the wikispecies-filter.py script and then the wikispecies-uniquer.py
to do the final cleanup, finally creating a .brz zip file with those .json text files.

Simply import the .brz file to use.
